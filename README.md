# PortToyModel
## Purpose:
    - Producing a State-space representation of the problem space

## Program specific Choices:
    - Boxes are labelled 1,2...N
    - Truck schedule is randomized
    - Currently, 

## Recommendation:
### Linux/unix:
    Run with ```python3 ./Simulation.py > output.txt``` iff verbose. (Pipes output to output.txt)
### Windows: 
    Run with ```python ./Simulation.py > output.txt``` iff verbose. (Pipes output to output.txt)
